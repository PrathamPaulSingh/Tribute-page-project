            <p class="head">Dr APJ Abdul Kalam’s Contribution to Missile Project</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Under his command, he had a team of India’s best soldiers.
                He simultaneously served as Prime Minister’s Chief Scientific Adviser from July 1992 to December 1999, and also the Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
                In 1998, Kalam and Dr Soma Raju collaborated to design a low-cost coronary stent. The stent was dubbed the “Kalam-Raju Stent.” For rural health care, the “Kalam-Raju Tablet” was created in 2012.
                The Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998 proved India’s nuclear capabilities. Without Dr Kalam’s assistance, this project would not have been possible. Such weapons, he explained to the international community, would serve solely as “weapons of peace” to discourage other countries from the annexation of Indian territory.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">As a young scientist in DRDO, Kalam was assigned his first pproject to design and develop a hovercraft for the country’sdefense applications. After several days of hard-work,he and his team were successful in developing India’s firstindigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, theimpressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva.</p>

            <p class="head">HE WAS PART OF THE TEAM WHICH SET UP TERLS</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Though Project Nandi was put in cold storage, due to it Kalam got a call from the Indian Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) to attend an interview at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). At the time, INCOSPAR was formed out of the TIFR talent pool. Among the members of the selection panel who interviewed Kalam was Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space Programme and the founder of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Dr. Sarabhai took a deep interest in Kalam and selected him as a rocket engineer in INCOSPAR. The team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part, set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963. TERLS is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.</p>

            <p class="head">KALAM WAS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF INDIA’S FIRST SLV</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In 1969, when INCOSPAR led to the birth of the ISRO, Kalam was transferred there and was initially involved in research about building rockets. In the early 1970s, ISRO introduced its own Satellite Launch Vehicle program owing to geopolitical and economic considerations. It was a program to develop the technology needed to launch satellites. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was made the project director of the program. Beginning with mechanical designing to electrical integration, Kalam single-handedly supervised every aspect of the project, which was a massive success. On July 18, 1980, Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) was successfully launched from Sriharikota range in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. It deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit. It was the first successful satellite launch that took place on Indian soil and thereby made India the seventh member of an exclusive club of space-faring nations in international society.</p>

            <p class="head">HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF AGNI AND PRITHVI MISSILES</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After the huge triumph of SLV-III and dedicating the paramount years of his life to ISRO, Dr. Kalam was issued transfer orders to DRDO, where he was given the responsibility to lead the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). According to the instructions of then Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, four missiles were to be developed simultaneously as part of the program. After years of consistent hard work and immense dedication, India got her first range of ballistic missiles, the Prithvi, the Agni, the Aakash, and the Nag. Out of the four, two missiles, namely, Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile; and Agni, an intermediate-range ballistic missile; were launched successfully. Due to this mammoth achievement under his leadership, India became a major military power and Dr Kalam became popularly known as the “Missile Man of India”.</p>
