            <p class="paragraph">On August 29, 1947, Ambedkar was appointed along with seven other members to draft an independent Indian Constitution. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was appointed as the chairman of the drafting committee. The constitution of Ambedkar guarantees and protection for a wide range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including religious freedom, the abolition of untouchables, and the prohibition of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar can certainly be regarded as the “chief architect of the Indian Constitution” due to his many outstanding contributions. His efforts to eradicate social illness are remarkable, which is why he is dubbed and oppressed as the “messiah” of the Indian Dalits.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice for the sick, destitute and the dying in Kalighat, Kolkata with help from Indian officials. She did so by seeking permission to use an old abandoned Hindu temple to the goddess Kali. Known as the Kalighat Home for the Dying, the hospice provided medical attention to those in need and it gave people the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith. In the words of Mother Teresa, it was “for people who lived like animals to die like angels — loved and wanted”.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Dr. Ambedkar saw education as an important tool for improving the overall well-being of the oppressed and underprivileged classes. He believed that education was a moral weapon in all social movements and that the more educated we were, the more opportunities we had for progress. Ambedkar recognized the importance of education in his struggle to free Dalits from Indian religious slavery. He hoped that the upgrade of the marginalized group of the country should be the work of the educated citizens of the country.</p>

            <p class="head">Political Role of Dr. Ambedkar </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Dr. Ambedkar used political tools to protect the interests of the Dalits. In the first Round Table Conference in London in November 1930 he demanded Separate Electoral for Dalits but Mahatma Gandhi in the Second Round Table Conference opposed the proposal. He even resists the proposal on the cost of his life, declaring his resolution of “last-unto-death”. After that, the conflict between them was resolved by the “Poona-Pact”.  The Poona-Pact was an agreement between Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar(on behalf of the lower classes). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional Legislatures within the general electorate. Due to this agreement depressed class gained 148 seats in the Legislature.</p>
